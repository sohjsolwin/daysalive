# Why DaysA.live?

Time is the only true currency we have.

We celebrate birthdays once a year, but thousands of days pass in between—each one a unique coordinate in your personal timeline.

DaysA.live exists to help you find the hidden gems in those numbers.
- Your **10,000th** day alive.
- The day your timeline hits a **Prime Number**.
- When your life aligns with the **Solstices and Equinoxes**.

It's a tool for reflection, celebration, and finding a little bit of magic in the math of existence.


## Making Milestones Matter

As we age, the number of days we've lived can feel like a never-ending stream. Years begin to fly by, and suddenly 365 days doesn't feel like quite enough. You celebrate your birthday on the same day, in the same type of weather, in the same type of locations every year. 

What if you could change that date?

Every 500 days from your birthdate, you could celebrate a milestone on a new day of the year, in a new season, with a new backdrop. 

You get extra time in between so you can plan something larger or more meaningful, and if you ever want something extra, you have myriad ways to intersect importance into your timeline with meaningful numbers, overlapping holidays, or even searching for that perfect alignment with the stars.

I hope you join me in celebrating the hidden gems in that make our #DaysAlive something special.
